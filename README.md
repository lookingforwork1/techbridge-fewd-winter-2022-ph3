- This repository was created for the book project
-  The index.html file will be used to log into the Book inventory system
-  The index file will access the main.html which will display a book entry tab, a Library tab to display the books after they are entered and a search tab
-  There are three users created to show different permission access. They are john, mark and mary. Their passwords are password1, password2 and password3 respectively. John has add and edit access, while Mark has only search capability. Mary has add, edit and delete access which is shown by the action tab
-  The styles.css file styles the index.html page
-  The login.js file structure the permissions of each user
-  The bookem.js file creates the book class, the library class and displays the library.
-  The tabs.js displays the tabs in the main. This is in effect a SPA file (single page access file that is displayed in the main.html page)
